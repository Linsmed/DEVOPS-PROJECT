# MEAN -STACK

## What is MEAN-STACK
-MEAN stands for:

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- AngularJS
- Node.js.

- MEAN is an end-to-end JavaScript stack largely used for cloud-ready applications. MEAN is a full-stack development toolkit which is also refer to as a collection of JavaScript technologies used to develop web applications from the client to the server and from server to database, everything is based on JavaScript. It is also free and open-source stack which offers a quick and organized method for creating rapid prototypes for web-based applications.

### MEAN-STACK is composed of four different technologies

- MongoDB (Document database): Stores and retrieve data.

- AngularJS (Front-end application framework): Handles Client and Server Requests
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment): Accept requests and display results to end user
