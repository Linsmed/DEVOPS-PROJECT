  `sudo apt update`

  `sudo apt install nginx`

- To verify that nginx was successfully installed and is running as a service in Ubuntu, I ran:

`sudo systemctl status nginx`

- I accessed it locally in my Ubuntu shell, by running:

`curl http://localhost:80`

- To test how our Nginx server can respond to requests from the Internet. I opened chrome to access following url:
  `http://54.226.16.249/`

# STEP 2 - INSTALLING MYSQL

- Now that I have a web server up and running, MySQL Database Management System (DBMS) was installed to be able to store and manage data for the site in a relational database.

- To get MySQL installed, I ran this code:

`sudo apt install mysql-server`
